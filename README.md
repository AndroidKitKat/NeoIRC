## Danshou IRC

Danshou is a highly modified version of a demo IRC application called [NeoIRC](https://github.com/NozeIO/NeoIRC) built atop [swift-nio-irc](https://github.com/SwiftNIOExtras/swift-nio-irc). I am building this application due to me being unhappy with the state of IRC clients on iOS. The design is built entirely with SwiftUI and intended to feel and behave like a SwiftUI application.
